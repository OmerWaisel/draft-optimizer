The following code is designed to be a system for automatically deciding what's the optimal order for a unit to list Malshab's for a Draft.
The system takes as input the following parameters:
1. A list of malshabs, already prioritized, with their corresponding characteristics (e.g gender, profile)
2. A list of other units malshabs, non-prioritized
3. The order in which the units gets to choose

The system will act in the following way:
1. Read all the ingest data and parse it into the designated objects
2. Ask for a command each time, which can be one of the following:
  a. Enforce the next pick (assign to the relevant unit move on with the choosing order)
  b. Recommend who's your next pick based on all pre-assigned parameters
  c. Skip the next choice of the following unit (if necessary for some reason, e.g a unit calling an ID of someone that is not on your list)
3. The system will also document all actions done, in case a mistake is made, so we can recover it from a given point
